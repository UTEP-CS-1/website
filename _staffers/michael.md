Hello all!  I'm a software engineer supporting YouTube engineers with a focus on test health metrics. I moved around a lot growing up and currently work from home in Cincinnati, OH.  I've been with Google for 2 years and worked in market research for 10 years prior to that.  Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, stage acting, and tinkering on my collection of Raspberry Pis.
