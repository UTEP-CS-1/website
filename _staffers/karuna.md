Hello! I’m Karuna and I work as a software engineer for Android Security at Google NYC. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2018, where I studied computer science, helped teach the data structures & algorithms class and helped plan our college hackathon. These days in my free time I like to run, listen to music, and play tennis, soccer and dodgeball. Please don’t hesitate to reach out and ask about anything!
