Hello hello, my name is Smruthi (pronounced like smoothie with an 'r')! Iâ€™m a software engineer at Google, working on building developer tools and infrastructure for YouTube Music. I grew up near San Francisco and graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science in 2022, where I TA'd for the introductory course on data structures! In my free time I love to hike, read in sunny parks, paint, drink green tea, and learn jiujitsu. Looking forward to meeting you all :)
