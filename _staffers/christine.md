Hi everyone! I'm Christine and I'm a software engineer at Google in the Sunnyvale, CA office. I've been at Google for 4 years, and I currently work on Apigee, Google Cloud's API management product, on API Security. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019, and I spent a lot of time teaching the introductory data structures course.

Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions, whether it be about the course, industry, Google, etc.; I'm more than happy to help! Looking forward to meeting you!
