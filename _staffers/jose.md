Hi there! I'm Jose Cabrera and I'm a Software Engineer working on the YouTube Android App (no, I don't have any control over the Ads). I've been @ Google for a little over 4 years. Before Google I worked as a TA @ UTEP for over 2 years, eventually graduating with a Masters Degree in Software Engineering. I grew up in Ciudad Juarez so I'm very comfortable speaking Spanish if that's your language of choice. Looking forward to helping everyone achieve their potential. OH YEAH!
