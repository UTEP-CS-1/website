Hi there! I'm a Software Engineer for ShopX (Shopping on Google Search) and I specialize in front-end development. I'm a Bay Area native (Northern California) and work from the Mountain View campus. I studied Computer Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and worked in web development for five years before joining Google in 2020. I enjoy playing guitar, drums, and Dungeons and Dragons (not at the same time). Hope we can all have a great year together!
