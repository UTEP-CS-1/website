I am a software engineer at Google working with the YouTube MainApp EngPprod team. Before Google, I lived the last 20 years in Puerto Rico working for HewlettPackard Enterprise and Microsoft. I am originally from Mexico where I graduated in Computer Engineering in 1994. I had some experience teaching classes from my time in college where I taught data structures and file structures classes. Looking forward to meeting and working with all of you.
