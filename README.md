- `labs` and `clabs` contain released Lab and Comprehensive Lab specs, including starter code and assets (images) for those labs.
- `_modules/week-01.md` controls the table of contents on the landing page.
- `staging_labs` can be used as a secret folder to store lab specs being drafted. They are public on the internet and can be found if the URL is known, but it should remain unlinked until it is ready for students. The secret URL matches the directory path, something like: "https://utepcs1.org/staging_labs/xyz/spec/".
